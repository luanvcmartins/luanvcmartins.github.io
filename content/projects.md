OncoAssist

#description
A software developed at A.C.Camargo Cancer Center that implements a questionnaire to collect actionable patient
information. This data is then used to automatically train a machine learning model to predict the risk of hypocalcemia
in newly registered patients, using SHAP to justify the classification result. **It
won the Alumni award in NextFrontiers' 24.**
