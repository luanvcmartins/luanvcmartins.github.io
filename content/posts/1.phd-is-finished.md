I studied a technique for Graph Neural Network, which we apply to histopathology image segmentation task.
Additionally, we also proposed an annotation software and several annotated datasets.

## Histopathology application

The first step was to identify a suitable application to test our proposal. Given our interest in applying the technique
to health-related applications, we chose the highly relevant and impactful area of histopathology image analysis,
specifically focusing on segmentation tasks. This work was conducted in collaboration with A.C.Camargo Cancer Center.

### WSI2ML: annotation software

One of the first challenges we encountered was the lack of machine learning-oriented annotation software that would
allow us to delegate tasks efficiently, track annotation efforts systematically, and validate whether our annotation
efforts were successfully addressing the task or project objectives we had set out to achieve. To overcome this, we
decided to propose our own in-house solution, focusing particularly on enabling the validation of models and the
improvement of the dataset over different iterations.

</figure>


The software was developed using web technologies, including Flask for the backend, SQLAlchemy for database management,
and Vue for the user interface. For handling and displaying histopathology slides, we utilized the OpenSlide library,
and to handle annotations for large image format, we developed our own annotation library.

The software has been deployed in A.C.Camargo Cancer Center ever since and was crucial in creating several
annotated datasets that resulted in publications and other projects within the institution. We published a paper
describing the software in WebMedia '23, and the software is also publicly available
on [GitHub](https://luanvcmartins.github.io/WSI2ML/).

### Resulting datasets

Throughout the years, several datasets have been annotated with the proposed tool:

- **Gastrointestinal dataset**: A dataset created for segmentation tasks in histopathology images of the
  gastrointestinal tract. I used this dataset to highlight this aspect of our results in my thesis.
- **Background and tumor detection dataset for breast tissues**: A dataset focusing on background and tumor segmentation
  in histopathology images of breast tissues. This dataset has played a part in a 2024 publication.
- **Cytological dataset**: A dataset designed for cytological analysis tasks, aiding in further understanding
  cellular-level abnormalities in citological images. This dataset is associated with a Ph.D. project that was concluded
  in 2025.

## Activation map-based Graph Neural Network

We also studied a **Message Passing-based Graph Neural Network (GNN)** method, inspired by discussions with
pathologists regarding their experience in analyzing histopathological images. As a result, this method aims to model
connectivity patterns by representing the presence or absence of elements of specific features within a defined
neighborhood and leveraging a Neural Network to extract meaningful patterns from these representations.

The core idea involves using **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** to project high-dimensional feature data into a
lower-dimensional representation. By doing so, we can characterize a neighborhood by identifying and activating regions
on this map corresponding to features present in the local neighborhood. This approach enables the network to extract
connectivity patterns and relationships based on the spatial and feature context present in histopathology images.

    <img src="/imgs/1-gnn-framework.png" alt="Message Passing GNN proposed workflow.">

</figure>

This method enhances interpretability by providing a clear visual representation of the feature activations through the
activated map, allowing researchers to understand which features in the local neighborhood contribute to the
model's predictions. This combination of spatial and feature context significantly aids in understanding neighborhood
relationships while maintaining good performance in tasks that demand such insights, such as histopathological
segmentation.

## Thesis organization

In the thesis, we present the results as they were obtained: in an incremental way. We started with the development of a
custom **annotation tool** designed to meet the specific needs of the histopathological segmentation task. This tool was
fundamental in the creation of **high-quality annotated datasets**, from which several were created, and we
highlight the **Gastrointestinal dataset**. We complete the cycle by training the **GNN method** on that dataset,
demonstrating the interdependence between the tool, the data, and the model's performance. Finally, we use the
advantages to interpretability that the method grants to understand the patterns and contrast them to a pathologist,
which validated the patterns the model learned.
