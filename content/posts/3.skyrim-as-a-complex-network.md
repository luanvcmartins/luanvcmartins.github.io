For the past weeks, I have been playing around the Skyrim's Fandom wiki dump, which I had downloaded as a case study for
building a [RAG layer for local LLMs](/posts/skyrim-rag-for-local-llm-skyrim-knowledge). However, while I used
the full page's body text to create this RAG system, many other types of information could have been
exported from the database, such as tables, sections, and links. Indeed, I left a note stating that a more comprehensive
analysis of the page could be a future work.

In particular, I was interested in exploring the relationship between different pages and how different NPCs interact
with each other. For this purpose, I decided to put the `networkx` package to use and build a graph to explore a few
metrics from this complex network. The graph has all the nodes related to NPCs, Cities and major locations, and quests.

The graph has three types of nodes, representing the NPCs (circle), quests (triangles), and cities (square). The plot is
made using networkx plotting functionality with `force_atlas2_layout` function to organize the nodes. The node size is
given by its `degree_centrality` and the color is the node's community from a `greedy_modularity_communities`.

## Cities

The most central elements are, of course, the cities, which function as hubs to find new people and identify new quests
and things to do. In terms of `degree_centrality` (people to see and things to do), `Riften` takes the top along with
`Solitude`.

| title            | degree_centrality |
|:-----------------|------------------:|
| Riften           |               0.1 |
| Solitude         |               0.1 |
| Whiterun (city)  |              0.09 |
| Markarth         |              0.08 |
| Windhelm         |              0.08 |
| Raven Rock       |              0.04 |
| Dawnstar         |              0.04 |
| Morthal          |              0.03 |
| Falkreath (city) |              0.03 |
| Riverwood        |              0.03 |

## NPCs

Next, we see how the NPCs are scattered around the world. In the game, the NPCs and quests have factions associated
with them. Coloring the nodes by the faction highlights how they are organized, showing that NPCs from the same factions
stick close together.

It's interesting to see that NPCs related to the College of Winterhold and the Dawnguard NPCs stay
distant from the main hubs. In contrast, the NPCs related to the civil war (Imperial Legion and Stormcloak) stay closer
to the center of the plot.

### Highly connected NPCs

Let's check who the network says are the characters the player will likely encounter. For this purpose, we employ the
degree centrality to see due to how connected they are to many factions of the game. Indeed, `Delvin Mallory` is a
quest-giver from the Thieves Guild, which provides quests that often combine several places and
people. Next, there is `Ulfric Stormcloak`, the leader of the rebellion, followed by `Nazir` from the Dark Brotherhood
and `Alduin`, the main antagonist.

| NPC               | faction          | race     | degree_centrality |
|:------------------|:-----------------|:---------|------------------:|
| Delvin Mallory    | Thieves' Guild   | Breton   |             0.023 |
| Ulfric Stormcloak | Stormcloaks      | Nord     |             0.023 |
| Nazir             | Dark Brotherhood | Redguard |             0.020 |
| Alduin            |                  | Dragon   |             0.019 |
| Maven Black-Briar | Black-Briar      | Nord     |             0.018 |
| Mercer Frey       | Thieves' Guild   | Breton   |             0.017 |
| General Tullius   | Imperial Legion  | Imperial |             0.017 |

### Bridges NPCs

However, some NPCs play a crucial role in allowing the player to interact with more close-off factions.
Sorting NPCs by the `betweenness_centrality` highlights a few names, such as `Glover Mallory` (Dragonborn DLC),
`Serana` (Dawnguard DLC), `Neloth` (Dragonborn DLC), and `Sinding`, who is crucial in
the [Ill Met by Moonlight](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ill_Met_by_Moonlight){target="_blank"} quest.

| title          | faction          | betweenness_centrality |
|:---------------|:-----------------|-----------------------:|
| Glover Mallory |                  |                  0.036 |
| Delvin Mallory | Thieves' Guild   |                  0.017 |
| Neloth         |                  |                  0.016 |
| Serana         |                  |                  0.015 |
| Nazir          | Dark Brotherhood |                  0.015 |
| Alduin         |                  |                  0.013 |
| Sinding        |                  |                  0.012 |

## Quests

Let's focus on the quests and their factions, then. We plot the title of the top 95% `betweenness_centrality` quests.

![](imgs/skyrim-graph/graph-factions-quest.png)

### Quests that glue the world together

Those are the quests that are highly central and connect different parts of the map:

| Quest                        | faction               | betweenness_centrality |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------------|-----------------------:|
| No Stone Unturned            | Thieves' Guild        |                  0.069 |
| Season Unending              |                       |                  0.043 |
| The Fishing Job              | Thieves' Guild        |                  0.036 |
| The Final Descent            |                       |                  0.032 |
| Reluctant Steward            |                       |                  0.030 |
| The Dark Brotherhood Forever | Dark Brotherhood      |                  0.028 |
| Prophet (Vampires)           | Clan Volkihar         |                  0.024 |
| Revealing the Unseen (quest) | College of Winterhold |                  0.023 |
| The Staff of Magnus (quest)  | College of Winterhold |                  0.022 |
| The Hunt                     | Clan Volkihar         |                  0.022 |

By far the `No Stone Unturned` is the most central quest, as it involves finding and gathering gemstones scattered
around the map. The `Season Unending` is about stopping the civil war, again, involving several places and NPCs.

In terms of factions, the Thieves' Guild is again one of the most connected ones using `degree_centrality`, followed by
the civil war factions and the Dark Brotherhood.

| faction          | degree_centrality |
|:-----------------|------------------:|
| Thieves' Guild   |            0.0067 |
| Stormcloaks      |            0.0067 |
| Imperial         |            0.0061 |
| Dark Brotherhood |            0.0059 |
| Blades           |            0.0050 |

However, using the `betweenness_centrality`, it highlights the quest from factions in the periphery of our network, such
as the ones introduced by the Dawnguard DLC and the `College of Winterhold`,
[famously cast away from the rest of Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/College_of_Winterhold_(Skyrim)#Distrust)
{target="_blank"}.

| faction               | betweenness_centrality |
|:----------------------|-----------------------:|
| Clan Volkihar         |                 0.0078 |
| Thieves' Guild        |                 0.0070 |
| Dawnguard             |                 0.0042 |
| College of Winterhold |                 0.0036 |
| Dark Brotherhood      |                 0.0035 |

## Clusters

Finally, here are the major relationships between the community structure and the game's content.

![](/imgs/skyrim-graph/graph-community-commented.jpg)

The highlights are:

- `College of Winterhold` castaway status is reflected in the community structure of the network, where the members are
  highly connected to themselves, sharing not that many connections with the outside.
- The `Dragonborn DLC` content is on a new map, accessible by ship only. As a result, it displays a large community with
  few bridges.
- In contrast, the `Dawnguard DLC` stays on the original map, sharing much more references with the rest of the game.
  Still, the new content most often interact with itself than the rest of the map, forming a community.
- The Forsworn faction and its content is pretty much restricted to Markarth. The same also happens with some members
  and quests of the `Thieves' Guild` being adjacent to `Riften` or the `Gray-Mane` in `Whiterun`.
- There is a cluster near `Falkreath` related to the  _Sinding's quest_ (Ill Met by Moonlight). It's
  interesting to see it displayed so distinctively in the network, as when I first played it many years ago, I also did
  find it unique: as it seemed like there was much more effort put into it than the rest of the quests in the
  game.

## Concluding remarks

It has been fun employing somewhat complex or advanced concepts to silly ideas, such as building that RAG layer for
Skyrim or putting the effort into understanding how Skyrim is organized. Despite the silliness, I find it's good to keep
practicing concepts I learned some time ago.

Additionally, I am also trying to practice the process of setting up goals, creating projects, implementing them to the
end, and reporting results. So making a blog sharing nonsense projects I spend my on seems like a good opportunity to
keep practicing and exercising creativity.
