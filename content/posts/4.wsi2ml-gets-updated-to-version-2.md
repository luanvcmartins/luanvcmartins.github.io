After several years of use in supporting various ML projects within the A.C.Camargo Cancer Center institution, I've
had the opportunity spend the last few weeks working on an updated version of the WSI // ML software, the annotation
software I developed during my Ph.D. This update addresses the evolution of underlying technologies and enhances the
software’s role in our ML workflows.

This software implements a framework (Fig. 1) that enables the construction of high-quality histological datasets from
large histological images (Whole Slide Images). It streamlines the process by creating clear tasks for pathologists, and
it allows project coordinators to easily track annotation progress.

## What has changed

This major update brings significant improvements to usability, performance, and functionality. Specifically:

- The web client has been completely rewritten with Vue3, resulting in a more intuitive user interface compared to the
  first version. We've also improved project organization, making it easier to navigate tasks and manage the datasets.
  Performance has also been improved, especially when loading multiple slides. The slide listing now displays a
  thumbnail
  preview for each image, streamlining the selection process.
- A key feature of this update is the ability to open and annotate multiple slides simultaneously, allowing slides from
  the same patient to be visualized at the same time. Revision tasks are now better integrated into the workflow and
  allow
  for easy visualization of colleague annotations without the need to define a specific revision task, with the same
  functionality applied to model predictions.
- We've also implemented version control for datasets, allowing you to download previously generated versions whenever
  needed. Furthermore, you can now upload model annotations directly into the software for comparison and refinement --
  previously this was done by the annotator out of the software.
- Under the hood, we've transitioned the backend to MongoDB, replacing the previous SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL setup for
  increased flexibility and simplicity. The docker usage has also been revamped: the docker is composed of three
  containers containing the backend, frontend, and a MongoDB server instance.

## Concluding remarks

The ongoing development and use of this software—years after its initial release and the conclusion of several PhD
projects at A.C.Camargo—highlights its significant impact on the work of the Cancer Center. I am proud of the journey
that took place during my PhD.
